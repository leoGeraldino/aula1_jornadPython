<h1>aula1_Jornada Python</h1>

#Description

This project is part of <i>Jornada Python</i> from <i>Hashtag Treinamentos</i> and consists of an automation process where the objective is to insert data from a '''.csv''' file in a web system, in an automated way with Python.
The logic behind the project was built with '''pyautogui''' library. With this module, an automation was done, first to login in the system and then, to input data on it. But how the algorithm open the '''.csv''' file? It's simple, with '''pandas''' library, all the data from the file was stored in a variable used in the algorithm. After that, one <i>for</i> loop scroll through the table and send data to variables that store some data and are inputted in the system with '''pyautogui''' commands.
